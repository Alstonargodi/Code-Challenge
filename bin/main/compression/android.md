"Comparative Analysis of Image Compression Algorithms in Kotlin for Mobile Applications." 
This study will compare the performance of different image compression algorithms in Kotlin, 
such as JPEG, PNG, and WebP, in terms of compression ratio, image quality, and processing time. 
The study will also evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms for mobile applications.


Image compression algorithms are used to reduce the size of digital images while retaining their quality. Here are some commonly used image compression algorithms:

Lossless Image Compression: 
This compression algorithm is used to reduce the size of an image without losing any information. 
It uses mathematical algorithms to compress the
